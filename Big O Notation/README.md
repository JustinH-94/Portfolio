#Big O Notation
This code demonstrates my understanding of Big O Notation.

## Constant
For this example, I placed a value inside of an array and have the console display the value of the array in that index. 
This is an example of a Constant O(1) because the output is only 1 item that is being displated. So it'll constantly take the same amount of time to display the value.

##Linear
For this example, I let a method run through all the elements of an array and have the console display each value.
This is an example of Linear O(n) because the the code is taking time to display each value, one by one.

##Quadratic
For this example, I used a double loop to display element 1 in the first array and then all the elements in the second array, then will finally move to the second element
in the first array. This will run until the first array reaches 100 elements.
This is an example of Quadratic O(n^2) because the operations done will greatly increase over time as the code runs through the double array.
